# PDF Upload Service

## Overview
This application provides a simple service to upload PDFs and attach them to a specified endpoint. It supports authentication via Microsoft Dynamics Business Central (MSDBC) access tokens and utilizes OData for content attachment management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest LTS version recommended)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [ts-node](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/)

### Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

### Running the Application
To start the application, run:
```sh
npx ts-node app.ts
```

### Accessing the UI
Once the application is running, you can access the UI via the browser at:
```
http://localhost:9000
```
Alternatively, you can make HTTP requests directly to the API endpoint.

## API Endpoint

     -F "baseUrl=https://your-api-endpoint.com" \
     -F "attachmentId=ATTACHMENT_ID" \
     -F "eTag=ETAG_VALUE"
